<!-- ## Welcome to GitHub Pages -->

Hello! I am fourth-year undergraduate at Wellesley College, studying Computer Science and Philosophy. I also studied at University of Oxford, Worcester College.

My research objective is to execute technology-driven participatory action research to mitigate social and technical challenges faced by groups that are oppressed by their intersectional identities. By extending theoretical frameworks to understanding how design and technology can engender social change, I aim to design technologies with and within oppressed groups to cultivate equity and self-determination.
