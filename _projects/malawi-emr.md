  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p><strong>Background:</strong> Lighthouse Trust, one of Malawi’s largest public HIV care programs, is testing a tablet-based app to extend electronic medical records (EMRs) to rural, low-connectivity community settings.</p>

  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> While promising, this new app requires broad stakeholder buy-in. There is limited understanding of how stakeholders perceive digital security and privacy in device-enabled electronic medical record (EMR) systems, particularly in low-resource environments.</p>

  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Evaluate whether stakeholders’ perceptions of digital risk align with actual practices, and identify opportunities to strengthen client data protections.</p>

  <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Conducted a qualitative study with both data stakeholders and HIV clients to understand their experiences, concerns, and desired safeguards for mobile EMR tools.</p>

  <h2>Qualitative Study</h2>

  <p><strong>Participants:</strong> 11 data stakeholders and 63 HIV clients at Lighthouse Trust.</p>
  <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Semi-structured key-informant interviews, focus groups, and thematic analysis.</p>

  <p><strong>Participant groups:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nurses (data stakeholders)</strong> — Provided care in community settings using both paper and tablets.</li>
    <li><strong>Data clerks & IT officers (data stakeholders)</strong> — Entered tablet data into the central EMR and managed technical protections.</li>
    <li><strong>Data decision-makers (data stakeholders)</strong> — Ministry of Health and policy representatives shaping data regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>HIV clients</strong> — Enrolled in facility- or community-based care.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Findings: HIV Clients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Trusted digital systems more than social privacy risks.</strong><br>
      Clients feared accidental disclosure of HIV status within their communities more than digital breaches, trusting providers to protect data security.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Partial understanding of digital data use.</strong><br>
      They knew tablets stored and shared health data but lacked clear explanations from providers, leaving uncertainty about data handling and sharing.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Findings: Data Stakeholders</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Recognized security gaps at care and national levels.</strong><br>
      Issues stemmed from both human error (weak passwords, unattended devices) and systemic limitations (no standardized data-sharing protocols).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advocated strong governance and oversight.</strong><br>
      Recommendations included Ministry-led project management, enforceable data-sharing laws, and periodic third-party security audits.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Design Recommendations for Secure Digital Systems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🗣️ <strong>Communicate clearly to clients</strong> how their data is collected, stored, and shared, using accessible, non-technical language.</li>
    <li>📱 <strong>Leverage clients' familiarity with mobile technologies</strong> to increase trust and adoption.</li>
    <li>🔒 <strong>Align with global security standards</strong> such as the Principles for Digital Development and the Health Data Governance Principles to ensure robust, highly-secure technologies.</li>
  </ul>
