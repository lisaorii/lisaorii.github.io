  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p><strong>Background:</strong> This is follow-on work from 
    <a href="/projects/kenya-contraceptive-app/">this project</a>. Pharmacies are a key access point for contraceptive services for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-24 in Kenya, but pharmacy providers have limited capacity to offer AGYW-specific counseling.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> <a href="/projects/kenya-contraceptive-app/">Formative work</a> suggested that while the contraceptive decision-support app has potential, AGYW were hesitant to ask questions to the pharmacist after using the app.</p>

  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand possible and preferable designs for chatbots in contraceptive care in Kenyan pharmacies.</p>

  <p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Develop speculative chatbot prototypes.</li>
    <li>Lead co-design workshops with AGYW and pharmacy staff in Kenya.</li>
    <li>Identify design guidelines.</li>
    <li>Test technical feasibility of design guidelines by building functional chatbots.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Speculative Chatbot Prototypes</h2>

  <p><strong>Speculative design</strong> provides the advantage of exploring possible future scenarios for emerging technologies even if stakeholders are unfamiliar with these technologies.</p>
  
  <p>Our low-fidelity prototypes were informed by our understanding that AGYW have varied digital and language literacy levels.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Text Chatbot:</strong> user types a question or response into a textbox to receive a text-based response.</li>
    <li><strong>Buttons Chatbot:</strong> user directs the conversation by choosing an option from a set of predefined topics.</li>
    <li><strong>Avatar Chatbot:</strong> user gives voice commands and chatbot provides audio responses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Co-Design Workshops in Kisumu, Kenya</h2>
  <p>We conducted co-design workshops with 36 AGYW and 12 pharmacy staff in Kisumu, Kenya. Workshop activities included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Journey mapping:</strong> Visualized the entire pharmacy visit experience, identifying pain points and moments of joy.</li>
    <li><strong>App engagement and discussion:</strong> Engaged with the <a href="/projects/kenya-contraceptive-app/">contraceptive decision-support app</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Chatbot prototype feedback:</strong> Prototypes shown and used as design probes to discuss what partiicpants liked, did not like, and wanted to change .</li>
    <li><strong>Chatbot ideation:</strong> Discussion and sketching of ideal chatbots.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Chatbots offer a safe space.</strong> Participants agreed that chatbots offer a non-judgmental space to ask questions and get unbiased information.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Navigating informational boundaries.</strong> AGYW wanted to ask the chatbot everything, but pharmacists wanted boundaries (e.g., abortion should not be asked to a chatbot).<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tensions between chatbot conversation privacy and utility.</strong> AGYW wanted to ask the chatbot everything, but pharmacists wanted to access conversations to understand the AGYW and guide them in decision-making.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
