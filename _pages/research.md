&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advised by *Professor Danielle Wood* (MIT Media Lab)
* Conducted mapping visualizations and analyses of vegetation data in Benin.
* Designed and engineered a low-cost water quality sensor kit to survey the health ecosystem in Benin. Programmed the microcontroller for data collection and wireless data transmission, and configured electrical and hardware components to extend the kit's lifespan. The kit was transferred to Benin and enabled scientists to mitigate the harms posed by the plant.
