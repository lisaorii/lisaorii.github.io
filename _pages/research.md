### COVID-19 in Africa
Advised by *Professor Richard Anderson* (University of Washington)
* Investigated reasons for systematic underreporting for COVID-19 data through interviews with people in Uganda and Ghana.

### Designing for Speech Practice Systems
Advised by *Professor Takuji Narumi* (University of Tokyo)
* Led a project that investigated the impact of listening to speech role models and voice manipulation on the perception of speech and voice. Provided design recommendations for a speech practice tool to assist users with speech practice and enhancing self-perception.

### Monitoring the Health Ecosystem of Benin
Advised by *Professor Danielle Wood* (MIT Media Lab)
* Conducted mapping visualizations and analyses of vegetation data in Benin.
* Designed and engineered a low-cost water quality sensor kit to survey the health ecosystem in Benin. Programmed the microcontroller for data collection and wireless data transmission, and configured electrical and hardware components to extend the kit's lifespan. The kit was transferred to Benin and enabled scientists to mitigate the harms posed by the plant.
