# Selected Research Projects
I have led and engaged in research projects in various fields. Here are a few of my favorite ones! A full list of my research projects are in my [CV](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/lisaorii/cv/raw/main/LisaOrii_CV.pdf).

## Sidewalk Accessibility and Social Inequity
Exploring crowdsourced labeling datasets of sidewalks to examine the correlations between sidewalk accessibility and socio-demographics.
Advised by *Professor Jon E. Froehlich* (University of Washington)

## Designing for Speech Practice Systems
Led a project that investigated the impact of listening to speech role models and voice manipulation on the perception of speech and voice. Provided design recommendations for a speech practice tool to assist users with speech practice and enhancing self-perception. Our paper was conditionally accepted to CHI 2022!
Advised by *Professor Takuji Narumi* (University of Tokyo)

## Trucking and Automation
Led a project that investigated truck drivers' perspectives on automation in the trucking industry.
Advised by *Professor Orit Shaer* (Wellesley College)
[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3409118.3475154) in AutomotiveUI '21
[Extended Abstract](https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3451637) in CHI 2021

## Urban Well-Being
Led a project to develop a well-being index to measure and analyze social welfare in urban ecosystems based on urban indicators such as safety and security, community connectedness, and diversity.
Advised by *Dr. Luis Alonso* (MIT Media Lab)
[Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/22/9458/pdf) in *Sustainability*

## Monitoring the Health Ecosystem of Benin
Conducted mapping visualizations and analyses of vegetation data in Benin.
Designed and engineered a low-cost water quality sensor kit to survey the health ecosystem in Benin. Programmed the microcontroller for data collection and wireless data transmission, and configured electrical and hardware components to extend the kit's lifespan. The kit was transferred to Benin and enabled scientists to mitigate the harms posed by the plant.
Advised by *Professor Danielle Wood* (MIT Media Lab)
